				'Intact bulb disposal:Please place bulbs in their original box (if possible) or otherwise secure them to prevent breakage during storage and transport. Please do not tape bulbs together.Broken bulb disposal:If a bulb breaks, follow these clean-up tips. Bring the bulb and the remaining debris (contained in a sealed plastic bag) to the Williston Drop-Off Center or to the Environmental Depot by appointment only. Due to hazardous waste and safety regulations, customers are limited to 5 broken bulbs per day at the Williston Drop-Off Center. Larger quantities must be brought to the Environmental Depot by appointment only. Fees may apply for large quantities of broken mercury containing bulbs.WHY are mercury containing lamps banned from landfills?Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal. When lamps are improperly disposed of, mercury can be released into the environment in the form of an invisible vapor or a bead. While the amount of mercury in these lamps is not believed to be enough to cause illness, it is best to avoid any exposure to mercury and prevent its release into the environment where it can damage our lakes and streams and poison fish and wildlife. In a typical compact-fluorescent bulb, there is only enough mercury to fill the letter “o” in the word “GOD” on a dime.A law went into effect July 1, 2012 governing the collection and recycling of mercury containing light bulbs in Vermont. More on this law may be read at lamprecycle.org.',
